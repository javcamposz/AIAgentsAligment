However, the maintenance protocol introduces a significant risk due to limited generator capacity (2 hours) and high business impact. \n\nTo address this:\n1. We need to assess the feasibility of completing critical deployment steps (e.g., system backup and code deployment) within the 2-hour generator window. If not feasible, alternative power solutions must be arranged immediately.\n2. The deployment steps (system backup, code deployment, testing, and verification) will be executed with utmost efficiency and precision.
